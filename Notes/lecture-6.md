This lecture covers **GloVe embeddings**, a word embedding technique that combines principles from **count-based** and **prediction-based** approaches, enabling effective word representation through co-occurrence data and addressing some limitations found in Word2Vec. Here’s a structured summary of key points:

### Objective Function for GloVe
The GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) method creates embeddings by leveraging word co-occurrence statistics:
- The objective function uses **logarithmic weighting** of co-occurrence counts $\log(x_{ij})$, where \( x_{ij} \) is the co-occurrence of word \( i \) with word \( j \).
- Minimizing this objective aims to approximate the **logarithmic relationship** between word pairs, capturing nuanced semantic relationships.

--- 

### Handling High Co-occurrence Counts
- High-frequency words (like "the" or "is") may distort embeddings by giving them undue weight.
- To mitigate this, GloVe introduces a **weighting function \( f(x) \)** that scales down high-frequency pairs:
  - For very low counts, it’s close to zero, allowing sparse co-occurrence information.
  - It is **non-decreasing** to ensure no reduction for valid co-occurrences as counts increase.
  - Beyond a threshold $x_{\text{max}}$, the weight becomes constant to prevent high-frequency pairs from dominating the embedding process.

### Learning Process in GloVe
1. **Two Embeddings per Word**: Each word has two vectors: a **target** vector \( w_i \) and a **context** vector \( w_j \).
2. **Optimization**: GloVe uses **gradient descent** to minimize the objective function concerning both vectors, leading to embeddings that reflect the word's meaning and context.
3. **Hybrid Approach**: The method merges count-based characteristics (from statistical language models) with prediction-based attributes (like those in neural network language models), making it adaptable and robust across various contexts.

### Advantages of GloVe
- **Scalability**: Efficiently trains on large corpora due to its count-based nature.
- **Generalization**: Performs well with small datasets, unlike Word2Vec, which often requires vast data to generate accurate embeddings.

### Applications and Limitations
1. **Word Analogies**: GloVe embeddings capture **linear relationships** in vector space, allowing for analogies (e.g., "king" - "man" + "woman" ≈ "queen").
2. **Bias in Embeddings**: GloVe, like other embedding models, can **inherit and amplify biases** present in data, such as stereotypical associations (e.g., "man: doctor" = "woman: nurse").
3. **Semantic Shifts Over Time**: Embeddings allow for interesting **historical language analysis**:
   - By training embeddings across different time periods (e.g., 1950s vs. 2010s), we can observe how word meanings evolve, such as "broadcast" shifting from agriculture to radio.

### Transition to Transformers
These static embeddings lay foundational knowledge for advanced **transformer-based models** that will be discussed in future lectures. These embeddings serve as initial representations in deeper neural networks for **language modeling** and **natural language processing (NLP) tasks**.

This concludes the discussion on GloVe, highlighting its hybrid strengths, practical uses, and contributions to the field of NLP.
